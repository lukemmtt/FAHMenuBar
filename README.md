- **Improved Engagement:** Making folding visible encourages ongoing participation.

## Getting Started

- Folding\@home v8 client installed ([Download here](https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/))
- Intel or Apple Silicon Mac

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/lukemmtt/FAHMenuBar/releases).
2. Unzip and move `FAH MenuBar.app` to your Applications folder.
3. Launch the app‚Äîit will appear in your menubar.

**Option 2: Build from Source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukemmtt/FAHMenuBar.git

```

## Usage
