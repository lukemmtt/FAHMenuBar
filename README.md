## What is this?

Folding@home for macOS only provides a web interface. This menubar app gives you quick native access to:

- **View folding status** - See if you're actively folding or paused
- **Pause/resume folding** - One-click folding commands
- **Monitor progress** - Real-time progress bar and ETA for current work units
- **Native macOS integration** - Lives in your menubar like other system tools

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Real-time status** - Shows current folding state and progress
- ‚úÖ **One-click commands** - Pause/resume folding instantly
- ‚úÖ **Progress tracking** - Visual progress bar with percentage and ETA
- ‚úÖ **Native design** - Matches macOS design language
- ‚úÖ **Lightweight** - Minimal resource usage
- ‚úÖ **Auto-updates** - Built-in Sparkle framework for easy updates

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- Folding@home v8 client installed and running
- Intel or Apple Silicon Mac

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Pre-built App (Recommended)

1. **Download** the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/lukemmtt/FAHMenuBar/releases)
2. **Unzip** the downloaded file
3. **Move** `FAH MenuBar.app` to your Applications folder
4. **Launch** the app - it will appear in your menubar

### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukemmtt/FAHMenuBar.git
cd FAHMenuBar
open FAHMenuBar.xcworkspace
# Build and run from Xcode
```

## Usage

1. **Ensure Folding@home is running** - The menubar app connects to your local FAH client
2. **Click the cube icon** in your menubar
3. **View status** - See if you're folding, paused, or stopped
4. **Use commands** - Click "Pause" or "Fold" to change your status
5. **Monitor progress** - Watch the progress bar and ETA for current work units

## How it Works

This app connects to Folding@home v8's official WebSocket API to:
- Retrieve real-time folding status and work unit information
- Send pause/resume/fold commands
- Monitor progress and display updates in the menubar

It does NOT:
- Send data to external servers
- Modify your FAH configuration files
- Interfere with the normal operation of Folding@home

## Troubleshooting

**App shows "Disconnected"**
- Ensure Folding@home v8 is installed and running
- Check that FAH is accessible at http://localhost:7396 in your browser

**Commands don't work**
- Make sure you're running Folding@home v8 (not v7)
- Restart both the FAH client and this menubar app
